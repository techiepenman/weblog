# Weblog
A responsive design for a Weblog.

# Motivation
Design a responsive layout without using frameworks. In this project elements orientation and layout are being controlled with Flexbox and CSS Grid.
The layout is structured using grid columns and rows and the view port is being observed to change layout and styling as page is resized.
